		<p style="padding-right: 800px;">Punjab, state of India, located in the northwestern part of the subcontinent. It is bounded by Jammu and Kashmir union
        territory to the north, Himachal Pradesh state to the northeast, Haryana state to the south and southeast, and Rajasthan
        state to the southwest and by the country of Pakistan to the west. Punjab in its present form came into existence on
        November 1, 1966, when most of its predominantly Hindi-speaking areas were separated to form the new state of Haryana.
        The city of Chandigarh, within the Chandigarh union territory, is the joint capital of Punjab and Haryana.
        
        The word Punjab is a compound of two Persian words, panj (“five”) and āb (“water”), thus signifying the land of five
        waters, or five rivers (the Beas, Chenab, Jhelum, Ravi, and Sutlej). The word’s origin can perhaps be traced to panca
        nada, Sanskrit for “five rivers” and the name of a region mentioned in the ancient epic the Mahabharata. As applied to
        the present Indian state of Punjab, however, it is a misnomer: since the partition of India in 1947, only two of those
        rivers, the Sutlej and the Beas, lie within Punjab’s territory, while the Ravi flows only along part of its western
        border. Area 19,445 square miles (50,362 square km). Pop. (2011) 27,704,236.&nbsp;</p>

        <h2 style="text-decoration: underline;"> Land</h2>
        <p style=" padding-right: 900px;" >elief, drainage, and soils
            Punjab spans three physiographic regions, the smallest being the Siwalik Range in the northeast, where elevations
            reach
            about 3,000 feet (900 metres). Farther south, the narrow, undulating foothill region is dissected by closely spaced
            seasonal torrents, locally known as chos, several of which terminate in the plain below without joining any stream.
            To
            the south and west of the foothills lies the broad flat tract, with low-lying floodplains separated by slightly
            elevated
            uplands. This region, with its fertile alluvial soils, slopes gently from an elevation of about 900 feet (275
            metres) in
            the northeast to about 550 feet (170 metres) in the southwest. The southwestern part of the plains, formerly strewn
            with
            sand dunes, has mostly been levelled off with the expansion of irrigation projects.</p>
            <h2 style="text-decoration: underline">Climate</h2>
            <p style=" padding-right: 900px;">
            Punjab has an inland subtropical location, and its climate is continental, being semiarid to subhumid. Summers are very
            hot. In June, the warmest month, daily temperatures in Ludhiana usually reach about 100 °F (upper 30s C) from a low in
            the upper 70s F (mid-20s C). In January, the coolest month, daily temperatures normally rise from the mid-40s (about 7
            °C) into the mid-60s F (upper 10s C). Annual rainfall is highest in the Siwalik Range, which may receive more than 45
            inches (1,150 mm), and lowest in the southwest, which may receive less than 12 inches (300 mm); statewide average annual
            precipitation is roughly 16 inches (400 mm). Most of the annual rainfall occurs from July to September, the months of
            the southwest monsoon. Winter rains from the western cyclones, occurring from December to March, account for less than
            one-fourth of the total rainfall.

                Ballads of love and war, fairs and festivals, dancing, music, and Punjabi literature are among the characteristic
                expressions of the state’s cultural life. The origins of Punjabi literature trace to the mystical and religious verse of
                the 13th-century Sufi (mystic) Shaikh Farīd and to the 15th–16th-century founder of the Sikh faith, Guru Nanak; those
                figures were the first to use Punjabi extensively as a medium of poetic expression. The works of Sufi poet Waris Shah
                greatly enriched Punjabi literature in the second half of the 18th century. Contemporary in the 20th and early 21st
                centuries Punjabi literature found some of its greatest exponents in poet and author Bhai Vir Singh and the poets Puran
                Singh, Dhani Ram Chatrik, Mohan Singh “Mahir,” and Shiv Kumar Batalvi; renowned novelists included Jaswant Singh Kanwal,
                Gurdial Singh, Giani Gurdit Singh, and Sohan Singh Shital, among others. Kulwant Singh Virk is one of the best-known
                writers of short stories in Punjabi.
                
                Punjab holds numerous religious and seasonal festivals, such as Dussehra, a Hindu festival celebrating the victory of
                Prince Rama over the demon king Ravana, as recounted in the epic Ramayana; Diwali, a festival of lights celebrated by
                both Hindus and Sikhs; and Baisakhi, which for Hindus is a new year’s festival and for Sikhs is both an agricultural
                festival and a celebration of the birth of the community’s Khalsa order. There also are numerous anniversary
                celebrations in honour of the Gurus (the 10 historical leaders of Sikhism) and various saints. Dancing is a typical
                feature of such festivities, with bhangra, jhumar, and sammi among the most popular genres. Giddha, a native Punjabi
                tradition, is a humorous song-and-dance genre performed by women. In addition to Sikh religious music, semiclassical
                Mughal forms, such as the khyal dance and the ṭhumrī, ghazal, and qawwālī vocal performance genres, continue to be
                popular.

<h1>Topography</h1>
<p>The district forms a part of the Indo- Gangetic plain and consists of three types of region :-</p>
<ol>
<li>The Upland Plain.</li>
<li>The Cho-infested Foothill Plain.</li>
<li>The Floodplain of the Ghaggar River</li>
</ol>
<p>Apart from this, the district has a complex drainage system consisting of canals and rivers. The river Ghaghar is the most important water channel of the district. It is essentially a seasonal stream, remaining dry during most part of the year. However, during the rainy session, it remains in spate, often flooding the adjoining villages, causing damage to crops, livestock and at times to houses and human lives. A number of subsidiary rivulets join the Ghaggar River, the most important ones being the Tangri Nadi, Patiala-Wali-Nadi, Sirhind Choe and the Jhambowali Choe.</p>
<p>Apart from the natural drainage line, the district also has three important canals- The Bhakra Main Line canal, the Nawana Branch, and the Ghaghar Link. These canals provide much needed irrigation water to the district. Before these canals were constructed, Patiala district was a water scarce area. These irrigation canals have helped to transform the parched fields into fertile, double-crop lands.</p>
